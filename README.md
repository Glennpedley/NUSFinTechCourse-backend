# NUSFinTechCourse-backend
This is the work for a Group Project to connect the front end to the back to run CRUD sql commands in the backend from the web browser.
This is one of the most rewarding project as is hihglights the front end to back end parts.
All the files can be obtained in the ezyzip file for download.

Basically, 
Group 5 HTML deals with the front end, the html side.

Database1.js deal with the connection to the SQL database.

Getdata1.js deal more like an API to fetch the data using the "GET" function.

main.js is where we "run" the file in node js. WHen this file runs, it connects to the other files (via codes stated in here)

member.js this file deals with the four main functions of an API, CRUD (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT) and alters the database accordingly if needed.
